The translator itself is initialized without any parameters, as any configuration to it is optional. A translator without any translations will do nothing but return all messages verbatim. Adding translations Two options exist for adding translations to the translator: Add every translation file individually; use this for translation formats that store multiple locales in the same file. Add translation files based on a pattern; use this for formats that use one file per locale. To add a single file to the translator, use the addTranslationFile() method: use Laminas\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator; $translator = new Translator(); $translator->addTranslationFile($type, $filename, $textDomain, $locale); where the arguments are: $type : the name of the format loader to use; see the next section for details. $filename : the file containing translations. $textDomain : a \"category\" name for translations. If this is omitted, it defaults to \"default\". Use text domains to segregate translations by context. $locale : the language strings are translated from; this argument is only required for formats which contain translations for single locales. When storing one locale per file, you should specify those files via a pattern. This allows you to add new translations to the file system, without touching your code. Patterns are added with the addTranslationFilePattern() method: use Laminas\\I18n\\Translator\\Translator; $translator = new Translator(); $translator->addTranslationFilePattern($type, $baseDir, $pattern, $textDomain); where the arguments are roughly the same as for addTranslationFile() , with a few differences: $baseDir is a directory containing translation files. $pattern is an sprintf() -formatted string describing a pattern for locating files under $baseDir . The $pattern should contain a substitution character for the $locale \u2014 which is omitted from the addTranslationFilePattern() call, but passed whenever a translation is requested. Use either %s or %1$s in the $pattern as a placeholder for the locale. As an example, if your translation files are located in /var/messages/<LOCALE>/messages.mo , your pattern would be /var/messages/%s/messages.mo . Supported formats The translator supports the following major translation formats: PHP arrays Gettext INI Additionally, you can use custom formats by implementing one or more of Laminas\\I18n\\Translator\\Loader\\FileLoaderInterface or Laminas\\I18n\\Translator\\Loader\\RemoteLoaderInterface , and registering your loader with the Translator instance's composed plugin manager. Setting a locale By default, the translator will get the locale to use from ext/intl's Locale class. If you want to set an alternative locale explicitly, you can do so by passing it to the setLocale() method. When there is no translation for a specific message identifier in a locale, the message identifier itself will be returned by default. Alternately, you can set a fallback locale which is used to retrieve a fallback translation. To do so, pass it to the setFallbackLocale() method. Translating messages Translating messages is accomplished by calling the translate() method of the translator: $translator->translate($message, $textDomain, $locale); The message is the message identifier to translate. If it does not exist in the loader, or is empty, the original message ID will be returned. The text domain parameter is the one you specified when adding translations. If omitted, the \"default\" text domain will be used. The locale parameter will usually not be used in this context, as by default the locale is taken from the locale set in the translator. To translate plural messages, you can use the translatePlural() method. It works similarly to translate() , but instead of a single message, it takes a singular value, a plural value, and an additional integer number on which the returned plural form is based: $translator->translatePlural($singular, $plural, $number, $textDomain, $locale); Plural translations are only available if the underlying format supports the translation of plural messages and plural rule definitions.","title":"Translation"},{"location":"translation/#translation","text":"laminas-i18n comes with a complete translation suite supporting all major formats and including popular features such as plural translations and text domains.

Using Locale Using a locale is more convenient as laminas-validator already knows the appropriate postal code format for each locale; however, you need to use the fully qualified locale (one containing a region specifier) to do so. For instance, the locale de is a locale but could not be used with Laminas\\I18n\\Validator\\PostCode as it does not include the region; de_AT , however, would be a valid locale, as it specifies the region code ( AT , for Austria).

Using Custom Format Postal code formats are regular expression strings.

For instance, in English, we say \"0 cars\" and \"2 cars\" (plural) while we say \"1 car\" (singular). On the other hand, French uses the singular form for both 0 and 1 (\"0 voiture\" and \"1 voiture\") and the plural form otherwise (\"3 voitures\"). Therefore we often need to handle plural cases even without translation (mono-lingual application). The Plural helper was created for this. Plural Helper does not translate If you need to handle both plural cases and translations, you must use the TranslatePlural helper ; Plural does not translate. Internally, the Plural helper uses the Laminas\\I18n\\Translator\\Plural\\Rule class to handle rules. Setup Defining plural rules is left to the developer. To help you with this process, here are some links with up-to-date plural rules for tons of languages: www.unicode.org developer.mozilla.org Define plural Rules As an example, you could add the following code in your Module class: // Get the ViewHelperPlugin Manager from the ServiceManager, so we can fetch the // Plural helper and add the plural rule for the application's language: $viewHelperManager = $serviceManager->get('ViewHelperManager'); $pluralHelper = $viewHelperManager->get('Plural'); Rule for French $pluralHelper->setPluralRule('nplurals=2; plural=(n==0 || n==1 ? 0 : 1)'); The string reads as follows: First, we specify how many plural forms we have. For French, only two (singular/plural). Next, we specify the rule. Here, if the count is 0 or 1, this is rule n\u00b00 (singular) while it's rule n\u00b01 otherwise. Rule for English As noted earlier, English considers \"1\" as singular and \"0/other\" as plural. Here is how that would be declared: $pluralHelper->setPluralRule('nplurals=2; plural=(n==1 ? 0 : 1)'); Basic Usage Now that we have defined the rule, we can use it in our view scripts. French echo $this->plural(['voiture', 'voitures'], 0); // 'voiture' echo $this->plural(['voiture', 'voitures'], 1); // 'voiture' echo $this->plural(['voiture', 'voitures'], 2); // 'voitures' English echo $this->plural(['car', 'cars'], 0); // 'cars' echo $this->plural(['car', 'cars'], 1); // 'car'","title":"Plural"},{"location":"view-helpers/plural/#plural","text":"Most languages have specific rules for handling plurals.
